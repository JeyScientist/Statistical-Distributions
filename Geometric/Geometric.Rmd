According to a survey. 13% of Americans do not wear their seatbelt regularly.
1. What is the probability that a pollster calls exactly 8 people before reaching      someone who does not wear their seatbelt regularly.
2. What is the probability that the pollster calls between 6 and 10 people(inclusive) before reaching someone who does not wear their seatbelt regularly.
3. Agroup of 200 pollsters each counts the number of calls before reaching someone who does not wear their seatbelt regularly.Simulate the results.
```{r}
dgeom(8, .13)
```


```{r}
pgeom(10, .13)-pgeom(5,.13)

```
```{r}
calls <- rgeom(200, .13)
calls
```
```{r}
summary(calls)
``` 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
qplot(calls, geom="histogram", bins=44, col="blue")
```
