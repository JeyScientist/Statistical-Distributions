Flipper lengths of a certain kind of penguin are normally distributed with mean 192.9 mm and standard deviation 7.1 mm.

1. What is the probability that a randomly selected penguin has a flipper less than 200 mm long. More than 200 mm.

2. What is the 90 percentile for flppers length in these penguins.

3. Simulate 500 random selections from these population and plot the results. 
```{r}
pnorm(200, 192.9, 7.1)

```



```{r}
1-pnorm(200, 192.9, 7.1)
```



```{r}
qnorm(.90, 192.9,7.1)
```
```{r}
flippers <- rnorm(500, 192.9, 7.1)
flippers
```
```{r}
qplot(flippers, col=I("red"))
```


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
