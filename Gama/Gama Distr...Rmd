Calls to a customer service line come at an average rate of 1 every 3 minutes.
1. What is the probability that more than an hour elapses before 25 calls come in.
2. What is the 95 percentile for time needed for calls to come in.
3. Simulate waiting times for 5 calls 1000 times. Plot the results.
```{r}
1-pgamma(60, 25, 1/3)
```


```{r}
1-pgamma(60,25,scale=3)
```



```{r}
qgamma(.95,5,1/3)
```

```{r}
time <- rgamma(100, 5, 1/3)
time
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
qplot(time,col="yellow", bins=50, xlabel="waiting time"+ geom_violin(xintercept=27) )
```
