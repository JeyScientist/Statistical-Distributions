Calls to a customer service line come at an average rate of 6 every 5 minutes.

1. What is the probability that there are exactly 4 calls in a 5 minute period.
   That there are at least 4.
2.Construct a probability histogram for the number of calls to the line in a given 5   minute period.
3. Simulate the number of calls in 50 such periods.
```{r}
dpois(4,6)
```
```{r}
1-ppois(3,6)
```

```{r}
x=0:15
probs<- dpois(x,6)
probs
```



```{r}
qplot(x, weight=probs, geom ="histogram", bins=16, col=I("red"))
```
plotted the above vectors
```{r}
rpois(50,6)
