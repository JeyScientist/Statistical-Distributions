Acereal company randomly places 1 of 5 different toys in each box of its cereal. One particuler child is trying to collect 6 copies of their favourite toy. This is a negative binomial experiment with p=0.2 and r = 6.

1. What is the probability that they find the 6 copy of their favourite after finding exactly 25 other toys.

2. What is the probability that they must open at least 20 disappointing boxes before finding the 6 copy of their favourite toy.

3. Simulate the number of failures before the 6 success 1000 times and produce a histogram of the results. 

```{r}
dnbinom(25,6,0.2)

```{r}
1-pnbinom(19,6, .2)
```
```{r}
box <- rbinom(100,6, .2)
box
```
```{r}
qplot(box, bins=70,  geom="histogram",  col = I("blue"))
